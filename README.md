# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Visualization

### 1. Project

An end-to-end data analysis and visualization project designed to uncover patterns in loan approval, customer demographics, loan performance, and business KPIs using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

### 2. Description / Purpose

The Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution built to help financial institutions and analysts understand the performance of loans and customer segments. It enables decision-makers to identify trends, improve loan strategies, and reduce risks by leveraging multi-source data.

### 3. Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – For dashboard creation and interactive visuals

📂 Power Query – For data loading, transformation, and modeling

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create calculated columns, KPIs, and dynamic visuals

🧱 Data Modeling – Linking tables (customer, loan, performance) for cross-filtering

📁 File Format – .pbix for Power BI dashboard development

📊 Excel (.csv) – Used for initial data review and data cleaning

🛢️ Microsoft SQL Server – Used to store and manage cleaned data before loading into Power BI

### 4. Business Problem

Financial institutions need better insights into loan approval trends, default risks, and customer profiling to optimize lending decisions and reduce bad loans. Manual spreadsheets and static reports lack the depth and clarity needed for real-time analysis.


### 5. Goal of the Dashboard

To create a visual reporting tool that:

Provides real-time insights into loan approval rates, defaults, and recovery

Segments customers by employment type, credit score, income, and more

Tracks overall loan volume, performance, and risk

Supports strategic decisions around lending policies and marketing
